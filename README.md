Refer a Friend: Engineers Campus Hiring Program
We are pleased to launch Engineers Campus Hiring Program, an initiative to attract engineering students across India to join Goldman Sachs in Bengaluru. 
Guided by our business principle of identifying and recruiting the best talent, we take a deliberate approach towards building a workforce that represents the communities where we live and work. Through this program, we aim to reach the talent at universities and colleges that we as a firm have not engaged with in the past. Applicants will participate in an online assessment, following which the shortlisted students will be invited to interview for our 2020 internships and full-time roles. 
Program Details 
Individuals applying to the Engineers Campus Hiring Program should be in the pre-final and final years of graduation or post-graduation. The registration for the program closes on Saturday, August 17 at 11:59 p.m. IST.

If you know individuals who may be interested in the program, please direct them to the Engineers Campus Hiring Program page.

Online Assessment
Date: Sunday, August 18
Time: 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.
